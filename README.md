# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Travel History REST API with Flask
This Flask-based REST API lets users track and manage countries theyâ€™ve visited. It integrates with the Trevor Blades GraphQL API to fetch country metadata, stores it locally in SQLite, and supports operations like retrieval, filtering, updating, and visualizing travel history across continents.
# ðŸ§© Features
`PUT /countries/<code>`: Import a new country by 2-letter code or update an existing one.
`GET /countries/<code>`: Retrieve country details including visit history.
PATCH /countries/<code>: Add more years to a countryâ€™s visit history.
DELETE /countries/<code>: Delete a country record.
GET /countries: List all visited countries with:

Pagination (page, size)

Filtering by continent, language, currency, or year visited

Sorting by fields like name, last_updated

GET /countries/visited: Generate and return a PNG chart showing the most visited continents.

Automatic population of country data using the external GraphQL API.

HATEOAS-style _links field in responses for navigation (self, prev, next).
